This guide describes additional setup required for the development environment of the Release Engineering team.


[[releng-devenv_rationale]]
== Rationale

We use Jenkins as our continuous integration environment.
This uses the link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Job DSL plugin] to create new pipelines based on a set of templates; these templates call Powershell scripts that are deployed via the `Z:` drive (`\\vssdmrelease\release`)

There is a close relationship between the build pipelines and these powershell scripts, and any error in them would be serious: it could potentially break all builds for all teams across all branches.

It's therefore important that changes and enhancements to these build pipelines are developed locally, and then deployed.
This requires:

* installing Jenkins 2.0 instance locally
* tweaking the Powershell profile to pick up modules from local drive (rather than the `Z:` drive)



[[releng-devenv_install-jenkins]]
== Install Jenkins

Jenkins can be installed using xref:index.adoc#software-prerequisites_chocolatey[Chocolatey].

[source,powershell]
----
choco install jenkins
----

This should install Jenkins as a Windows Service, listening on port 8080.
At the time of writing, this was Jenkins v2.32.1.

By default this Jenkins will run as 32bit but we need 64bit for it to run 64bit powershell on our local machine.
To change this open up `C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\jenkins.xml` file and change:

[source]
----
<executable>%BASE%\jre\bin\java</executable>
----

to

[source]
----
<executable>java</executable>
----

This will tell Jenkins to use the 64bit JRE you have in the local machines path instead of its default 32bit version.

Restart Jenkins as a Windows Service


[[releng-devenv_install-jenkins_unlock-jenkins]]
=== Unlock Jenkins

Access link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080], and you should see this message:

[source]
----
Unlock Jenkins

To ensure Jenkins is securely set up by the administrator, a password has been written to the log (https://jenkins.io/redirect/find-jenkins-logs[not sure where to find it?]) and this file on the server:

``C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword``

Please copy the password from either location and paste it below.
Administrator password
----

Open up that file and copy in the password as requested.

On the next page:

image::_images/Jenkins/select-plugins.png[link="_images/Jenkins/select-plugins.png"]

choose "Install suggested plugins"

On the next page:

image::_images/Jenkins/first-admin-user.png[link="_images/Jenkins/first-admin-user.png"]

You can either customize the admin user account (and click "save and finish"), or just accept the default (click "continue as admin").


[TIP]
====
You can change the password later using `Manage Jenkins > Manage Users`.

[[releng-devenv_customise_plugins]]
== Customise Plugins

We next need to install some additional plugins.

Using `Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Available`, install the following (these are the additional plugins deployed to `vssdmtest0049`, our CI server):

[[releng-devenv_sdmbuild1-account]]
== sdmbuild1 account

Chocolatey installs Jenkins to run under `LocalSystem`.
However, for proper git access we need to run using the `WELFARE\sdmbuild1` account:

* Set up `WELFARE\sdmbuild1` to be a local administrator on the PC: +
+
image::_images/Jenkins/sdmbuild1-as-administrator-locally.png[link="_images/Jenkins/sdmbuild1-as-administrator-locally.png"]
+
Then reboot.

* Next, set up the powershell profile for the `sdmbuild1` account. +
+
This should use the standard link:http://docserver/ReleaseEngineering/DeveloperGuide/setting-up/pc-setup-guide/_resources/_setting-up-powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1.txt[`Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`], copied to `C:\Users\sdmbuild1\Documents\WindowsPowerShell`

* Next, update the `sdmbuild1` profile so that it uses locally-checked out versions of the release engineering scripts (rather than the "production" versions deployed to the `Z:` drive). +
+
The standard profile (copied over in the previous step) defines a `Use-LocalModules` function: +
+
[source]
----
function Use-LocalModules {
    $env:PSModulePath = "D:\git\ReleaseEngineering\BuildScripts\PSModules;$env:PSModulePath"
    $env:PSModulePath = "D:\git\ReleaseEngineering\BuildScripts\PSModules\ThirdParty;$env:PSModulePath"
}
----
+
All you therefore need to do is to call this function by adding the following at the bottom of ``sdmbuild``'s profile: +
+
[source]
----
Use-LocalModules
----

* Finally, update the Jenkins service to run under the `WELFARE\sdmbuild1` account: +
+
image::_images/Jenkins/service-logon-sdmbuild1.png[link="_images/Jenkins/service-logon-sdmbuild1.png"]


You can confirm that this is working correctly by manualy creating a freestyle job with a single Powershell command:

[source]
----
write-host $env:PSModulePath
----

Run the job and confirm the path is correct (with locally checked out scripts earlier in the path than the "production" files on `Z:` drive).

[[releng-devenv_credentials]]
== Credentials

Set up a credentials key in order that the Jenkins git plugin can checkout code:

image::_images/Jenkins/credentials.png[link="_images/Jenkins/credentials.png"]

To do so:

* `Jenkins > Credentials > System`

* click on "Global credentials (unrestricted)"

* `Add Credentials`

* Enter:

** Kind = Username with password
** Scope = Global
** Username = `welfare\sdmbuild1`
** Password = (ask REM team)
** Id = `d14ef618-5e4f-4108-ae7f-db10f3cb5016` +
+
This ID is hard-coded in the pipeline templates.




[[releng-devenv_credentials-unset-git-credential-helper]]
=== Unset Git Credential Helper
There is a known issue that makes the git plugin to hang when fetching a git repository.

The plugin is likely to stop at this line:

[source,bash]
----
using GIT_ASKPASS to set credentials 
 > git.exe fetch --tags --progress http://vssdmlivetfs:8080/tfs/BOMiLiveTFS/BOMI_Infrastructure/_git/sdm.util +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
----

The reason is likely to be that:

_"the Jenkins Git Client plugin relies on the https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin/blob/2a2c6d339dcda8556b267f8a3584a5dd762be387/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/gitclient/CliGitAPIImpl.java#L1714[GIT_ASKPASS] variable being set, which according to credential helper https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials[documentation] is used when there are no credential helpers defined."_


To fix it, ensure the git credential.helper is not set.
open up a command line as an admin and type git config credential.helper and if anything is returned then you must run these commands bellow 

[source,bash]
----
git config --global --unset credential.helper
git config --system --unset credential.helper
----


See http://stackoverflow.com/a/37753202/2699981[this answer from Stack Overflow for full details].

[[releng-devenv_access_control]]
== Access Control for Builds
Starting with Job DSL 1.60, script security for Job DSL scripts is enabled by default if Jenkins security is enabled. https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Authorize+Project+plugin[Authorize Project plugin] provides the functionality to allow scripts to run.


Manage Jenkins \ Configure Global Security \ 
Tick 'Enable script security for Job DSL scripts' 

Manage Jenkins \ Configure Global Security \ Access Control for Builds \ Project default Build Authorization \ Strategy \ 
Select 'Run as User who Triggered Build'



== Deploy SdmServer
The job 'Deploy SdmServer' must run as the user 'Welfare\nonprodsqluser'.

Deploy SdmServer \ Bindings \ Credentials \ Add.

Deployments directory must be shared to allow cache to be copied.

[[releng-devenv_tools]]
== Tools

In addition to Powershell, the build scripts that generate documentation also use Maven (to run Asciidoc plugin) and the job to reindex the link:http://docserver[http://docserver] uses NodeJS.

If you want to run these jobs/scripts, you'll therefore need these tools installed using Chocolatey.

At this time there is no special configuration of Jenkins (eg to define tool locations); they are simply picked up from the `$env:PATH`.



[[releng-devenv_set-up-ci-snowflakes]]
== Set Up CI "Snowflakes"

The production link:http://ciserver[http://ciserver] has a number of "snowflake" jobs (ie custom jobs) which are used to seed other jobs.

Specifically, there is:
kykykik
* _Seed BomiArtifact Pipeline_ +
+
Used to create a pipeline for a single TFS team project/git repo

* _Seed All-in-One Pipeline_ +
+
Used to create a pipeline for the (`Trunk` repo of) a mirror of TFS holding the BOMi2/4 (eg `$/SDM_DEV_MIRROR/Trunk`, or `$/INTEG_MIRROR/Trunk`).

* _SeedAll_bomi_Artifacts +
+
Which will iterate over all team projects / git repos and create the appropriate pipelines.

When developing locally you will most likely be enhancing ether the BOMiArtifact Pipeline or the All-in-One pipeline, so you'll want to set up these snowflake jobs.
However, you probably won't need to run _SeedAll_bomi_artifacts.

Rather than set up these seed jobs manually, you can use the XML job definitions available in the link:http://vssdmlivetfs:8080/tfs/BOMiLiveTFS/ReleaseEngineering/_git/CISnowFlakes[ReleaseEngineering/CISnowFlakes].

Clone the repo, and then copy the jobs as necessary.
For example, to set up _Seed BOMiArtifact Pipeline_ and _Seed All-in-One Pipeline_, you should end up with:

[source]
----
- (Admin)
 +- config.xml
  - jobs
    + Seed BomiArtifact Pipeline
      - config.xml
    + Seed All-in-One Pipeline
      - config.xml
----

[[releng-devenv_Seed_All]]
== Seeding jobs in a generic way

We have at least 3 Jenkins Admin jobs. 

1) Seed-All Pipeline

2) Seed-Artifact Pipeline

3) Seed-All-In-One Pipeline

To generate these jobs we have created a very generic "Seed Job" called Bootstrap. 
It processes a given groovy file (Bootstrap.groovy) as DSL.


=== Creating the "Seed Job" Bootstrap

Once Jenkins is configured, the developer has to create a project on Jenkins called Bootstrap.

First create a new item.

image::_images/Jenkins/newItem.png[link="_images/Jenkins/newItem.png"]

Select Freestyle Project and call it Bootstrap.

image::_images/Jenkins/Bootstrap.png[link="_images/Jenkins/Bootstrap.png"]

In configuration, add the following Build Steps..

First, add to config the *Windows Powershell* step.

image::_images/Jenkins/PowerShell.png[link="_images/Jenkins/PowerShell.png"]

In Powershell Command add the following

[source]
----
cp "Z:\ReleaseEngineering\autopub\BuildScripts\CI\Bootstrap\Bootstrap.groovy" .
----

image::_images/Jenkins/windowsPS.png[link="_images/Jenkins/windowsPS.png"]

Second, add to config the *Process Job DSL* step.

image::_images/Jenkins/DSL.png[link="_images/Jenkins/DSL.png"]

Within the DSL Scripts add the Bootstrap.groovy file

image::_images/Jenkins/BootstrapDSL.png[link="_images/Jenkins/BootstrapDSL.png"]

Save and Build!!! 

You will see in the Admin folder that all 3 Seed jobs have been generated and are ready to be built.
