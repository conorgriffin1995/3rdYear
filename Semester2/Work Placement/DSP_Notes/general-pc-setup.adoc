== Introduction


These notes are based on setup of “**Win7x64DevVer4.0 **on a LENOVO i7 DEC PC starting from the “old” DEV PC Image @ 26/Nov/2013.

The end result is a CLONED PC IMAGE named “**Win7x64DevVer4.0”** – contact Gary Kavanagh or Dave Foster for a copy of this clone.

The setup is based on that image, the instructions here basically a consolidated and updated (hopefully improved) set of instructions across both BOMi2 and BOMi4 – based on previous developer documents for both
  platforms.

With minor changes (eg. Path names on C:\ drive instead of D:\ drive, this could also be used for DEV PC setup on an older HP box or Lenovo box).


[[__general-pc-setup]]
== GENERAL PC SETUP

=== Modified Folder Options to see filetypes etc.

image::_images/1.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/1.png"]

image::_images/2.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/2.png"]

=== _Microsoft Lync Install_

The DEV machines should all have Microsoft LYNC installed (used for Instant Messaging between buildings).

=== _Microsoft Office 2010 Install_

The base image has Microsoft 2010 setup on it – this is installed on C:\ drive.
If space becomes a problem (the C:\ drive in these machines is tight), developers may have to manually remove/install on D: drive instead.


== Visual Studio 2010 Install

This was already installed on the previous image.


== Configure Visual Studio for Development : recommend settings


=== Recommend Visual Studio 2010 settings

Tools” > “Options” and the below window will appear. +
Select “Projects and Solutions” +
Ensure the following boxes are ticked: 

* “Show advanced build configurations”
* “Show Output window when build starts”
* “Show all settings”

image::_images/3.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/3.png"]

Select “Text Editor” > “Basic” +
Ensure “Line Numbers” is ticked

image::_images/4.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/4.png"]

Select “Debugging” +
Ensure “Step over properties and operators(Managed Only) is NOT ticked

image::_images/5.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/5.png"]


=== _Running Visual Studio as an administrator - pin it to the start menu._

This is described for VS2010, but should work also for VS2012 – do it for both.

Click on start and find the “Microsoft Visual Studio 2010” exe and right click on it

Select “Pin to start menu”

image::_images/6.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/6.png"]

Click on the start button and then right click on “Microsoft Visual Studio” and choose properties.

image::_images/7.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/7.png"]

Select the advanced button

image::_images/8.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/8.png"]

Tick the box "Run as Administrator" and click OK.

image::_images/9.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/9.png"]

=== _Setting up VS Launcher._

It’s a convenience that when you click on a SLN file, it launches and determines the type of Visual Studio (2010, 2012 etc.) to run.

[NOTE]
====
This is not on the base image, and wasn’t tested on the LENOVO i7 machines.
====

go to start => run and type in “VSLauncher” (This may not be on your system, it’s not mandatory)

image::_images/10.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/10.png"]

Right click on the launcher and select Properties.

In the properties window choose the “Compatability” tab and ensure “Run as Administrator” is checked.

image::_images/11.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/11.png"]


== Visual Studio 2012 Install

Installed from media on Brendan Cowan’ss PCKMA0200 machine.
Installed Ultimate edition as per Brens’ advice.

image::_images/12.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/12.png"]

image::_images/13.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/13.png"]

image::_images/14.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/14.png"]

**Note: **Cancelled the install (should have done in administrator mode) , and them went to run it
again (in admin mode) & took the  “REPAIR” option when prompted. Maybe should
have uninstalled & reinstalled?, let’s see if any problems.?

image::_images/15.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/15.png"]

Opened Visual Studio & selected “C# Development Settings” as the default… +
Installed the VS update (as in setup docs) from a slightly updated location since the original doc was done +
http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs[http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs]

image::_images/16.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/16.png"]

WARNING: Needed to finish the local
SETUP before downloading/running the VS2012 “Update” above, since that starts
another setup/install.

While waiting for VS2012 update… **RAN OK.**

== Install NANT on SDM Developer PC's

Copy NANT from file:///\\cskma0242\Tools\Nant\nant+contrib-0.90[\\cskma0242\Tools\Nant\nant+contrib-0.90]
to **D:\Program Files\NANT**

Add C:\Nant\bin to the Environment Variable called “PATH”

                Go to: ControlPanel\All Control Panel Items\System

                Select: Advanced System Settings

image::_images/17.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/17.png"]

Click on Environment Variables

image::_images/18.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/18.png"]

Edit System Variable Called “Path” & Append “D:\Program Files\nant\bin”
(or wherever you copy-installed NANT)

Make sure to separate the previous entry with a semi-colon.

image::_images/19.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/19.png"]

== Checking the PowerShell Policy

In order to ensure powershell has the correct policy permissions to execute
scripts run the command

        Get-ExecutionPolicy

on both version of powershell.

*   32-bit can be found at %SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
*   64-bit can be found at %SystemRoot%\syswow64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe

After running the command you should see the response “Unrestricted”

image::_images/20.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/20.png"]

If you do not get this response from any version of powershell execture the
command

        Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted

on that particular version

image::_images/21.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/21.png"]

== Setting up Attunity for BOMi2 Development

=== _Give all users permissions to the Attunity folder on the DEV PC_
Go to the Attunity folder (eg. C:\Program Files\Attunity) and right-click, Properties, go to
“Security TAB”.

Click on “Users”,
“EDIT”, then click “Users” and click on “Full control” & other checkboxes, and press APPLY and then OK button.

image::_images/22.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/22.png"]

=== _Talk nicely to Johnathan Murphy and/or Caroline Courtney_
**Note: This has already been done on the **[underline]#Win7x64DevVer4.0#**
clone – no need to do this on individual developer machines any more – unless
specific datasources are needed. (**only some basic data sources - DEV1, SYS1
etc. have been installed by default**). All the firewall, security &
DTC configuration has been done on the clone and seems to have worked OK on
copies made from it.

The Attunity software needs some centralised administration done via an administration
console. Jonathan Murphy or Caroline Courtney have access to this software.

*   Caroline Courtney (DSP) on 43225
*   Dave O’Dwyer (DSP) on 43260
*   Jonathan Murphy (Bearing Point) on 40420

All of the above are very
helpful, but this is not “their job”, they are just the ones with the admin
software and who know how to use it. Tell them you are installing a new
Developer PC and ask for help with getting the Attunity settings configured –
you want the “DEV1” data sources, and whatever other black magic is needed for
connectivity. This can only be done remotely via the Attunity Admin software. 
[underline]#They will need your PC Name **(eg. PCKMA0NNN)**#

=== _Set up windows firewall to allow Attunity IRPCD.EXE and NAV_UTIL.EXE_
You need to set up INBOUND rules for attunity.

image::_images/23.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/23.png"]

image::_images/24.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/24.png"]

**Above: **Click “Allow Another Program”, and browse to both IRPCD.EXE and
nav_util.EXE (both separately) , and “ADD” them. This should leave you with both
Attunity programs listed in the screenshot below.

image::_images/25.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/25.png"]

Press OK to save it.

=== _Set up windows firewall [underline]#Inbound# Rules for Attunity_
Select “Advanced Settings”, then “Inbound Rules”, then “New Rule” option…

image::_images/26.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/26.png"]

[underline]#Below:# Select “Predefined”, and “Distributed Transaction
Co-ordinator”.

image::_images/27.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/27.png"]

[underline]#Below:# Click all 6 rules, and press NEXT.

image::_images/28.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/28.png"]

[underline]#Below:# "Allow the Connection", and press FINISH.

image::_images/29.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/29.png"]

This should leave you with 6 INBOUND Rules set up as follows.

image::_images/30.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/30.png"]

=== _Set up windows firewall [underline]#outbound# Rules for Attunity_

Do roughly same steps as for Inbound rules.

Select “Outbound Rules” on the left hand side, click “New Rule”, select “Predefined/”Distributed
Transaction co-ordinator”, and it will leave you with 2 outbound rules as in
the screenshot below.

image::_images/31.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/31.png"]

CLICK NEXT, allow the connection

image::_images/32.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/32.png"]

This will leave you with TWO outbound rules for DTC as in the screenshot below.

image::_images/33.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/33.png"]

=== _Configure DTC for Network Access_

Run “Component Services”, browse to “My Computer”, “Distributed transaction Co-ordinator”,
“LOCAL DTC” and select “Properties”, and go to the SECURITY TAB. Then click on
the checkboxes as in the screenshot below.

Click [underline]#APPLY# first and then OK.

image::_images/34.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/34.png"]

=== _Check that Attunity is working using "ChapView"_

image::_images/35.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/35.png"]

Using the Attunity “SQL Utility” , do the following as a test.

CONNECT to Attunity.

image::_images/36.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/36.png"]

Select the DEV1_AttCRSMain_RO data source from the list, and run “Select * from Client
limit to 10 rows”

image::_images/37.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/37.png"]

== INSTALL WINDOWS IDENTITY FOUNDATION - BOMi4 Pre-REQUISITE

Before doing this, you will need VS20**[underline]#12#** installed &
setup, and connected to TFS, got latest code 
etc.. (all in previous sections).

=== Install WIF
Browse to the link below:

http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17331[http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17331]

Please download the file with the name Windows6.1-KB974405-x64.msu and then
install it on the server

== Install .NET 4.5

Download and Install .NET 4.5 from Microsoft.com (Note: This
may already be installed with VS2012 – check in add/remove programs.)

http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653[http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653]

This will require a restart of the machine

== INSTALL ORACLE RDP Data Provider
This is now mandatory in order to be able to run the BOMi4
web application on your local DEV app server.

=== Install Oracle RDP Provider from

The Oracle Data Provider (as @ Oct 2012) available is available here

file:///\\cskma0289\Exploration\Software\OracleORDBDrivers%20for%20VS\ordt73220_2012[\\cskma0289\Exploration\Software\OracleORDBDriversfor VS\ordt73220_2012]

Run this in  Administrator mode …..!


=== Make the Oracle RDP Data Provider capable of running in 64-bit processes

The Oracle RDP Provider is a 32-bit install. It installs in the 32-bit
Program Files, and modifies the 32-bit machine.config file…. But is capable of
running in 64-bit mode. However, the install is not 64-bit aware. This means
that  you have to [underline]#manually# (very carefully!) copy the relevant config entries
from the 32-bit machine.config to the 64-bit machine config. This is not
necessary on development PC’s [underline]#IF# you are using the default VS appserver
(which is 32-bit), but it you are running full IIS in 64-bit mode (or
installing on a test or live server) … you will need to do the following in addition to the normal install. The
normal install itself (described above) is a one-click run the setup.exe
(important that it is run as as
administrator).

*   The install will install in the 32-bit
     machine.config
*   file:///\\vssdmtest0028\c$\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config[Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config]
*   If running 64-bit you need to copy the
     entries (manually) to the 64-bit machine.config file:///\\vssdmtest0028\c$\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config[Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config]

Edit the Machine.Config [underline]#in
administrator mode (ie. Start Notepad in admin mode – if not, you wont be able
to save the file).#

**Add this
inside </configSections>** +
<section name="oracle.dataaccess.rdbclient"
type="System.Data.Common.DbProviderConfigurationHandler, System.Data,
Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089"/>

**Add this
inside </DbProviderFactories>** +
<add name="Oracle Rdb Data Provider" invariant="Oracle.DataAccess.RdbClient"
description=".Net Framework Data Provider for Oracle Rdb"
type="Oracle.DataAccess.RdbClient.RdbFactory, Oracle.DataAccess.Rdb,
Version=7.3.2.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=24caf6849861f483"/>

[underline]#Note:# Both of these can be
copied over from the 32-bit version of the machine.config file where the
install puts them.

[underline]#Note#: If you install the
ORDP more than once on top of itself, the installer puts multiple copies of the
entry in DbProviderFactories .. which causes problems. Be aware of this &
make sure any uninstall has removed the ORDP entries from this list.

[underline]#Note:# This manual update
for 64-bit operation is necessary in order to run the BOMi4 web application in
full 64-bit IIS (as opposed to 32-bit DEV appserver in Visual Studio).

== Turn [underline]#OFF# "Compatibility Mode" in EI8

The standard client browser is Internet Explorer 8.  The default configuration in DSP is for any
Intranet sites to be opened in Compatibility mode.  This means that any requests to IIS get
treated as IE7 requests.  Naked Objects
requires IE8 or higher so this Compatibility mode needs to be disabled for
Intranet sites.

*   Open Internet Explorer, select Tools,
     select Compatibility View Settings.
*   Make sure “Display intranet sites in
     Compatibility View” is not checked.


image::_images/38.png[alt=general setup, link="_images/38.png"]

*   copy it into **D:\ProgramFiles\ILSPY**
*   PIN it to the start menu (and RC, “Advanced” and set “run as administrator”.

== BEYOND COMPARE - source code/text & folder comparison tool

Beyond compare 3 is already installed on the base image. Running it for the first time will require  a licence key. Paste in the
licence key below.
 
**[underline]#Note: LENOVO
i7 TEST MACHINE:#** This key may was installed on the LENOVO i7 test
machine, so may already be included in the LENOVO i7 DEV PC Image.

QUESTION: Is this a volume licence key 
- from recollection, I think it is ?
