This documentation has been ported from MS Word to Asciidoc, but has otherwise been reviewed.
Some of the information is likely to be stale.

== Changes required to IIS

* In IIS in the root, select “Server Certificates” as shown below:
+
image::_images/1.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/1.png"]

* In server certificates import your cert if production or else for development you can create a self signed cert as shown below.
+
image::_images/2.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/2.png"]
+
[NOTE]
====
This cert should be issued to the name of the PC/SERVER that IIS is on
(creating a self signed cert in iis will do this automatically.)
====

* After
creating/importing your cert you need to assign it to the website.
So in the website that the bomi is in you need to right click your website and select “Edit Bindings” as shown below:
+
image::_images/3.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/3.png"]

* This then brings you into the site bindings as shown below.
By default HTTP port 80 should be there.
Wer'e looking for HTTPS port 443, if this is not there select Add:
+
image::_images/4.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/4.png"]

* After pressing add you get the below screen.
Add a new binding for HTTPS on port 443 as shown below.
Select the cert from the drop down list that you created in the previous steps in “Server Certificates”: +
+
image::_images/5.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/5.png"]

IIS and BOMI4 should be setup now to be able to run over HTTP or HTTPS

[NOTE]
====
We might be able to get away with not using HTTPS for BOMI4.
ADFS requires the app to be HTTPS.
If the load balancer address is HTTPS ADFS will be happy enough.
After the call goes through the load balancer the BOMI can just be HTTP.
We would need to test though.
====


== Changes required to SQL Server

A new stored procedure is required that will be used to return all claim info that needs to come from the database eg roles, officer
location and grade.
This proc is as follows:

image::_images/code1.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/code1.png"]

NOTE: This proc is used by the claim rules attached to the
“Replying Party Trust” in ADFS.


== Changes required to ADFS

Connect into your ADFS server and open the ADFS Management Console.

image::_images/6.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/6.png"]

You should not need to make any changes to “EndPoints” which is marked in
blue above.
All other sections pointed to with a red arrow do have to be configured.
Each of these are as follows:


=== Certificates

This section should be setup from the installation for
you.
Things to check though.
Make sure that you have three certificates installed “Service Communications”, “Token-decrypting” and “Token-signing”.
Make sure that the certs have not expired.
If they have then replace them using the menu options on the right.

Double click the cert “Token-signing” as shown below:

image::_images/7.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/7.png"]

This will open up the cert.
When the cert opens select the “Details” tab and scroll down to “Thumbprint” as shown below:

image::_images/9.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/9.png"]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Copy out this “Thumbprint” into notepad++ (**[underline]#not
Notepad as it will not show you hidden characters!!!!#**)
====


Then remove all the spaces and hidden characters between the letters.
Hidden characters will be shown as “?”.
You will be left with something that looks like below:

“88B30DC559F10B33D90991C389944DC282519C1C”

Keep a note of this, you will need this later in the BOMI4 web.config file.


=== Claim Descriptions

In here you setup all the claims that are to be supported by this ADFS server.
We need to setup the different claims that we want to send to BOMI4.
To add a claim select “Add Claim Description” from the right hand menu.
You will get a screen like below:

image::_images/10.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/10.png"]

You will need to setup the following claims:


[cols="2,3",options="header"]
|====================
|Display Name
|Claim Identifier

|Name
|http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name[http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name]

|Role
|http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role[http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role]

|LocalOffice
|http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/LocalOffice[http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/LocalOffice]

|OfficerGrade
|http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/OfficerGrade[http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/OfficerGrade]

|Windows
|http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname[http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname]

We
might get away with not setting up this one as its passed through from AD.
Need to test

|====================

Its no harm ticking the two check boxes on the screen also to publish these claims

=== Claims Provider Trusts

You need to setup two trusts “Active Directory” and “federationservice.welfare.irlgov.ie” (you could possible set these up as one trust but just to keep things separate setup two).
These are shown in the screen shot below:

image::_images/11.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/11.png"]


==== Trust - Active Directory:
The most important thing about this trust is that there is a rule setup in it to pass through the claim that contains the windows account name eg “welfare\martinhughes”:

* After creating this trust if its not there right click it and select “Edit Rule”.
* Look for a rule that passes through the windows account name.
* If its not there select add rule.
* Then select “Pass Through or Filter an Incoming Claim”.
* On the next screen enter in a claim rule and select Incoming claim type “Windows account name”.
* Select the radio button “Pass through all claim values” as show below: +
+
image::_images/12.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/12.png"]
+
image::_images/13.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/13.png"]


==== Trust for federationservice.welfare.irlgov.ie

This trust needs to be setup with the below details:

image::_images/14.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/14.png"]

The url should be https://federationservice.welfare.irlgov.ie/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml[https://federationservice.welfare.irlgov.ie/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml]

image::_images/15.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/15.png"]

Note the “Claims provider identifier”.
You will need this later in the BOMI4 web.config file.

image::_images/16.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/16.png"]

When adding this certificate, this is the Signing certificate


=== Replaying Party Trusts

You need to setup one of these for the server that will be using ADFS.
In the below example it will be my machine.
It should be configured to look something like below:

image::_images/17.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/17.png"]

I left the feduration url blank to stop it trying to update from the federation metadata all the time.

image::_images/18.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/18.png"]

Enter the URL that will be used to access BOMI4

Just make sure on the EndPoints tab that your end point points to the below

https://PCKMA0280.welfare.irlgov.ie/Sdm.App/

Once you have the trust setup, you have to tell it what Claims to return to the replying party.
To do this right click it and select “Edit Claim Rules”.

We need 4 rules.
These are to be setup as follows:

[cols="2,3a",options="header"]
|====================

|Claim Rule Name
|Custom Rule

|IssueName
|
[source]
----
c1:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname"]
=> issue(Type = "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name",Value = c1.Value);
----

|IssueAllRolesForUser
|
[source]
----
c:[Type == "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name"]
 => issue(store =
"RolesFromDBForBOMI4", types =
("http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role"),
query = "EXEC [Security].[usp_ro_GetBOMI4Claims] @claimType='ROLE',
@userId={0}", param = c.Value);
----


|IssueLocalOffice
|
[source]
----
c:[Type ==
"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name"]
 => issue(store =
"RolesFromDBForBOMI4", types =
("http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/LocalOffice"),
query = "EXEC [Security].[usp_ro_GetBOMI4Claims] @claimType='LOCALOFFICE',
@userId={0}", param = c.Value);
----

|IssueOfficerGrade
|
[source]
----
c:[Type ==
"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name"]
 => issue(store =
"RolesFromDBForBOMI4", types = ("http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/OfficerGrade"),
query = "EXEC [Security].[usp_ro_GetBOMI4Claims]
@claimType='OFFICERGRADE', @userId={0}", param = c.Value);
----

|====================

After you have entered in the 4 rules you should have a screen that looks like the following:

image::_images/19.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/19.png"]

[IMPORTANT]
====
IssueName must be the first rule.
The “IssueName” claim is gotten from active directory from the “windowsaccountname” claim that was passed through.

The other three rules make a call to the dbBommain database via a stored procedure called `[Security].[usp_ro_GetBOMI4Claims]`.
This proc takes two paramaters:

* the first is the type of claims you want returned eg the users roles
* the second is the windows login eg “welfare\martinhughes” +
+
Must have the domain on the front, very important!
====


=== Attribute Stores

We need two attribute stores.

The first is Active Directory.
To set this up select “Add Attribute Store” on the next screen select the following:

image::_images/20.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/20.png"]

The second attribute store is a store to hold a connection to the database “dbBommain”.
It should be setup as follows:

image::_images/21.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/21.png"]

Note the above is fine for test but in a production environment the connection string should be setup like the below ie it uses integrated security.

*_Data Source=vssdm0043\DEV1;integrated security=SSPI;database=dbbommain_*

By doing this it will use the login details of the account attached to the ADFS windows service.
Make sure that this ADFS account has access to whatever database you are connecting to.

To see what account ADFS is running under do the following:

* Go into “Services” and double click “AD FS 2.0 Windows Service” +
+
image::_images/22.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/22.png"]

* This brings up a window, select the Log On tab as shown below: +
+
image::_images/23.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/23.png"]

This shows the account that is used when running ADFS. This
account must be a user on the sql server database.

=== How to turn on logging in ADFS

Sometimes when debugging issues you find that the browser will not give you much information around errors.
I found Chrome to give you better error messages than Internet explorer sometimes but generally the information given was poor.
To find out what was really going on and to get detailed error messages you had to turn on ADFS Event log logging on the ADFS server.

To do this follow the below steps:

* Open Event Viewer > Go to Applications and Services Logs > AD FS 2.0

* Right click and select View, Select Show analytic and debug Logs. +
+
You will see a new node for AD FS 2.0 Tracing.

* Navigate to AD FS 2.0 Tracing, Right click Debug, and select Enable Log.

* Start the ADFS Service and refresh the ADFS 2.0 Tracing Logs.


=== Changes required to BOMI4

[NOTE]
====
This is for WIF version 3.5 which the BOMI currently uses#**
====

The only change required in BOMI4 is in the `web.config` in the area of “microsoft.identityModel”.
BOMI4 already uses the WIF so we just need to configure the WIF not to use the old STS but to use the ADFS server.
The updated identity model section changes are below:

image::_images/code2.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/code2.png"]

In the above configuration the most important element are highlighted and a short description about these are below:

* “**issuer**” +
+
This is the URL to the ADFS server, this normally always ends with “/adfs/ls/”.
This is the URL that the WIF will redirect the users browser to in order for ADFS to ask for login details.

* “**realm**” +
+
This is the url that ADFS will redirect your browser to if the user successfully logs in.

* **“audienceUris**” +
+
After your user successfully logs in they will be redirected to the url in the “realm”.
If this url redirects or changes the browsers url then this audienceUris should match this final url.

* “**trustedIssuers**” +
+
This holds the trusted issuers thumbprint and name.
Important, this [underline]#thumbprint# is got from the signed certificate in ADFS.
The [underline]#name# is got from the “Claims Provider identifier” setup on the ADFS server under “Claims Provider Trusts”. +
+
See earlier in the document where you were asked to keep a note of these details.

=== Upgrading the BOMI to use WIF version 4.5

Below is the web.config changes for WIF 4.5.
This is slightly different in structure to what is there for WIF 3.5

image::_images/code3.png[alt=changes to bomi4, link="_images/code3.png"]

Specifically:

* delete the reference to the old WIF dll below from `sdm.app`:

[source,xml]
----
<Reference Include="Microsoft.IdentityModel, Version=3.5.0.0, Culture=neutral,
PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35, processorArchitecture=MSIL" />
----

* add a reference to the dotnet dll’s below:

** `System.IdentityModel.dll`
** `System.IdentityModel.services.dll`

* install the nuget package below to the `sdm.app` project:

[source,xml]
----
<package id="System.IdentityModel.Tokens.ValidatingIssuerNameRegistry" version="4.5.1" targetFramework="net452" />
----

After doing this you will notice that the app will not compile.
To get it to compile below are some of the code changes I had to make.

* Removed these `using` statements: +
+
[source,csharp]
----
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.WSFederation;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.SessionSecurityToken;
----

* Replaced these with the `using` statements: +
+
[source,csharp]
----
using System.IdentityModel.Protocols.WSFederation;
using System.IdentityModel.Services;
using System.IdentityModel
using System.IdentityModel.Tokens;
using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.SessionSecurityToken
----

The collection of “Claim” objects is now an IEnumerable.

As a result the code has to change as IEnumerable interface does not have a Count property or a FindAll method.
So I had to include “System.Linq” to give me a “Count()” method.
Then instead of using “FindAll” I used “Where” which is also part of “System.Linq” also.


== How to turn on logging in the WIF

Sometimes when debugging issues you find that the browser will not give you much information around errors.
Also the event log might not show any information.
I found Chrome to give you better error messages than Internet explorer sometimes but generally the information given was poor.
In WIF 4.5 the logging is actually quite good and detailed.

To turn on logging in WIF 4.5 do the following:

* Create a folder called “c:\logs” and in the `web.config` add the below just below the closing `</configSections>` element: +

[source,xml]
----
<system.diagnostics>
  <sources>
    <source name="System.IdentityModel" switchValue="Verbose">
      <listeners>
        <add name="xml" type="System.Diagnostics.XmlWriterTraceListener"
                        initializeData="C:\logs\WIF.xml" />                 <!--1-->
      </listeners>
    </source>
  </sources>
  <trace autoflush="true" />
</system.diagnostics>
----
<1> will output logs to the file “c:\logs\WIF.XML”
